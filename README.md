Quaternion library written in Rust.

This provides Quaternion operations and interconversion with several attitude 
representations as generic functions (supports `f32` & `f64`).

Additionally, it also works in a `no_std` environment!

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
quaternion-core = "0.5"
```

For use in a `no_std` environment:

```toml
[dependencies.quaternion-core]
version = "0.5"
default-features = false
features = ["libm"]
```

## Conversion

![Conversion (DCM <--> Quaternion <--> Euler angles)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HamaguRe/quaternion-core/master/conversion.png)

Interconversion with 24 different euler angles (12 each of `Intrinsic` and `Extrinsic`) 
is possible!!

Other interconversions with `axis/angle` and `rotation vector` are also possible.

## Features

### libm

If you set `default-features=false` (do not import `std`), you must enable this feature.

In this case, mathematical functions (e.g. `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt` ...) are provided by 
[libm](https://crates.io/crates/libm) crate.

### fma

When this feature is enabled, the 
[mul_add](https://docs.rs/num-traits/0.2.15/num_traits/float/trait.Float.html#tymethod.mul_add) 
method will be used internally as much as possible.
That is, `(s * a) + b` will be expanded as `s.mul_add(a, b)` at compile time.

This crate uses the `mul_add` method mainly to improve calculation speed, but if the CPU does 
not support the `FMA` (Fused Multiply-Add) instruction or if the `libm` feature is 
enabled, then the calculation is performed by the software implementation.
In this case, it may be rather slower than if the `fma` feature is not enabled.

### norm-sqrt

When this feature is enabled, the default `norm(a)` implementation is compiled with 
`dot(a, a).sqrt()` instead.

By default, the `norm(a)` function is implemented in such a way that overflow and 
underflow are less likely to occur than with `dot(a, a).sqrt()`. However, if extremely 
large values are not input and underflow is not that much of a concern, 
`dot(a, a).sqrt()` is sufficient (and `dot(a, a).sqrt()` is faster than the default implementation in most cases).

### serde-serialize

When this feature is enabled, `RotationSequence` and `RotationType` will both
implement `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize`.

## Example

```rust
use quaternion_core as quat;

const PI: f64 = std::f64::consts::PI;
const EPSILON: f64 = 1e-12;

fn main() {
    // Generates a quaternion representing the
    // rotation of Ï€/2[rad] around the y-axis.
    let q = quat::from_axis_angle([0.0, 1.0, 0.0], PI/2.0);

    // Rotate the point.
    let r = quat::point_rotation(q, [2.0, 2.0, 0.0]);

    // Check if the calculation is correct.
    let diff = quat::sub([0.0, 2.0, -2.0], r);
    for val in diff {
        assert!( val.abs() < EPSILON );
    }
}
```

## Development concept

In creating this crate, I tried to keep the implementation simple and practical.

All functions are implemented in such a way that the computational cost is as small as 
possible (but not too complex to implement), which is a great advantage for everyone.

Also, since I started creating this crate to experiment with attitude estimation, many parts 
were implemented with the intention of running on a microcontroller (e.g. the `norm-sqrt` feature).
