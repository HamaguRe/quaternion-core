# Version 0.4.2 (2023-06-02)

* Fixed a bug in the `to_rotation_vector` function. With that, version `0.4.0` and `0.4.1` were yanked.

# Version 0.4.1 (2023-05-28)

* Replaced the original pythag() function with the standard .hypot() method (because it was slow, even though the calculation results were the same).

# Version 0.4.0 (2023-02-05)

* The norm of the rotation vector  calculated by the `to_rotation_vector` function is now `[0, Ï€]`.
* The singularity at `theta=0` in the `to_rotation_vector` and `from_rotation_vector` functions has been removed.
* The behavior of the zero vector input to the `norm` function has been changed. Previous: zero-vector --> new: NaN.
* `rotate_a_to_b_param` function has been renamed to `rotate_a_to_b_shortest`.
* `rotate_a_to_b` and `rotate_a_to_b_shortest` functions now return `Option<Quaternion3<T>>`.
* `norm-sqrt` feature is added.
